This project was an attempt to make a running Android application
This is a carpooling app, with a lot of potential, and a lot more work to be put into

The app is fully functional (with some minor bugs) and open for anyone to try

Our team comprised 3 people: one for logistics, one for design, and one for marketing strategies.
Unfortunately, we abandoned the project because we went to different locations.
